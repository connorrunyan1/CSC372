# Go: A Language Exploration
* Authors: Connor Runyan & Jordan Siaha<br>
* Compiler Used: [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/)

## History
Go started originally as a personal side-project of a group of Google Engineers named Robert Griesemer, Ken Thompson, and Rob Pike.  They first began thinking about seriously about creating a new language in September 2007, and they had some working compilers by January 2008.  In November 2009 Go became open source, and all continued development since then has been managed by a group called the _Go Programming Language Project_.
## Paradigm

## Typing System

## Control Structures

## Support For Data Abstractions

## Syntax

## Semantics

## Desirable Language Characteristics

## Example Program
#### Un-Weighted _k_ Nearest Neighbors
```
if(code.isWritten()){
  this.replace(code);
} else {
  code.write();
}
```
