## History
Go started originally as a personal side-project of a group of Google Engineers named Robert Griesemer, Ken Thompson, and Rob Pike.  They first began thinking about seriously about creating a new language in September 2007, and they had some working compilers by January 2008.  In November 2009 Go became open source, and all continued development since then has been managed by a group called the _Go Programming Language Project_.

## Paradigm
Go is an imperative language.  Since it was written with low-level systems programming in mind, it looks and feels a lot like C from a distance, so much so that it is often viewed as what C would have looked like if it was written in the current century.  While Go does pilfer many tools and ideas from other language paradigms, it is most definitely still an imperative language.

---
## Typing System
Go is a strongly typed language, and type declarations are required.  Here are a couple of examples.  Note that the type of a variable is given after its name.
```Go
var radius float64   // declare a variable named radius of type float64
var width, height int = 50, 60   // allows multiple declarations on one line like this
```
Go also allows a programmer to use the following shorthand variable declaration/initialization operator, which is smart enough to figure out the type on it's own if it can.
```Go
message := "stringy literal"   // since this is a string literal, Go knows I mean:
                               // var message string = "stringy literal"
```
A programmer can also create new types.  This is in contrast to C, where the closest you could get to a new type would have been just declaring a struct.  Go extends that idea by letting a function definition specifiy what is called a _reciver_, in other words, the type that a function should operate on. Here is an example type definition, and then two different ways to write a function that makes use of it.
```Go
type Point struct {
  X, Y float64
}

// If you were in C, this sort of function would be your only option.
// It has to take the point you want as an argument.
func sum(p Point) float64 {
  return p.X + p.Y
}
// To invoke the above:
p := Point{5,6}
sum(p) // returns 11

// In Go, you can specifically bind a function to a type, called the reciever.
// This makes the function into a method, with a specific type it belongs to.
func (p Point) sum() float64 {
  return p.X + p.Y
}
// To invoke the above:
p := Point{5,6}
p.sum() // returns 11
```
Go also allows a programmer to treat functions as first class objects (or in this case, first class types).  They work like any other value.  Here is an example:
```Go
func printHelloWorld() {
  fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}

v := printHelloWorld
v()
```
The output of that above snippet would be `Hello, World!` printed out to console.  In Go, a function is like any other value.

---
## Control Structures
Go provides a fairly standard suite of control structures.  Naturally, we have the classic `for` loop.  While generally not interesting, it shows us some proof that programmers will still need their semicolon keys.
```Go
for i:= 0; i < 10; i++ {
  sum += i
}
```
The classic if/else/else `if` branching structure works like one would expect, as does the oft-overlooked `switch` statement.  Here is an example of those two:
```Go
if 5*5 == 25 {
  // this code is skipped if 5*5 isn't 25.
} else if 4 * 4 == 16 {
  // else if chaining works just like in C.
} else {
  // final catch-all else statement.
}

h := 7
switch h {
case 5:
  // if h had the value 5
case 6:
  // if h had the value 6
case 7,8:
  // Go lets you list multiple possibilities separated by commas
}
```
Go does not have a separate `while` keyword.  A `for` with a blank condition will loop eternally, so you'll have to include your own escape condition.  Go also has `goto` statements and labels, for some reason.  One interesting addition is the `defer` statement.  A statement with the modifier `defer` on the front will evaluate any needed arguments immediately, but not actually execute until the function it is in finished executing first.  The following function will output `First Second` to console.
```Go
func printStuff() {
  defer fmt.Print("Second")
  fmt.Print("First ")
}
```

## Support For Data Abstractions // TODO
As far as data abstractions, Go has examples of all 3 data abstraction types(Basic, Structured, Unit).  On the basic level, it has everything you would expect out of traditional variables.  You can manipulate data like integers or strings without having to deal with the individual bits and bytes directly.  For structured data abstractions, it has a similar suite as C. // TODO check textbook
Support for Data Abstractions â€“ which abstractions are provided, how can a programmer create
new ones?

---
## Syntax
Go has an interesting syntax, since it mixes a lot a C style with the "backwards" declarations from the Pascal family of languages.  Personally, we're not huge fans of the 'backwards' typing.  While this is likely due to the history we have with C-family languages, we also think that the type of a variable can often be more important than its name, and should come first as such.

---
## Semantics
Go is a statically scoped language.  As many systems languages do, Go prioritizes execution speed and does everything it can at compile time to reach that goal.  Go supports only a few types of constants: characters, strings, booleans, and numeric values.  The key here is that the idea of 'numeric values' is actually pretty smart in Go.  While compiling, it doesn't make the numeric constant into a specific type until it hits an instruction that would force it to.  By doing this, the value will only gain a type when a programmer uses it.  Storage allocation (static vs stack vs heap) is unfortunately inplementation specific.  The general rule, however, is that the compiler will do what is called _escape analysis_ to try and decide if the entity can live on the stack or if it has to be allocated on the heap.  The general rule is that variables that can live on the stack will, with the heap being a backup.  Heap allocation is used for most of the reference types, since their usage might extend outside of the function they were created in.  Go is fully garbage collected.

## Desirable Language Characteristics
### Efficiency
Go puts a very substancial pressure on being efficient.  Their website describes both compilation cost and execution cost as being very important.  To hit these goals, Go has relied on both a very restrictive typing system and a lack of some advanced features.  One standout omitted feature is generics.  The Go Project site states that adding them would have a huge compile cost compared to their usefulness, and so they remain unimplemented.
Go also focuses a lot on the cost of program maintenence.  Their site specifically mentioned that the original developers were not happy with C's dependency management, and the maze of inefficient .h files it creates.  Go has a very strict dependency management system.  So strict, that an unused import is actually a compile-time error.
The odd one out is the cost of program creation.  The syntax of Go is very specific, very finicky, and very restrictive.  You can get anything you need to get done, but it will definitely feel somewhat roundabout compared to languages that give you a little bit more help.  This trait, however, is in line with the systems programming oriented focuses.
### Regularity
Go is very similar to C or Java in terms of it's levels of generality and simplicity.  It generally does a good job, but carries over many of C's oddities, like the different ways to increment an integer.
Go does an exellent job of being highly orthogonal.  Constructs always work the same way, no matter where they are.  Depending on the construct, this even holds true when you start to introduce the parallel computing tools that Go offers.
Uniformity/Syntax design is probably the weakest part of Go's regularity.  One place this is very clear to me was with semicolons.  The Go compiler is written to allow the programmer to omit semicolons in many situations.  The issue is that some situations where you still need them do exist, most notably in for loops.
### Security/Reliability
This is where Go truely excels.  As a language written with systems programming in mind, security and reliability are extremely important.  It favors some insanely strict/strong typing rules.  One example we ran into is that you must explicitly cast an `int` (size left up to implementation) to an `int64` (64 bit integer in any implementation).  Rather than attempt any type promotion or inferencing, it forces you to exactly specify.
Go has some interesting ideas about exception handling.  It doesn't have exceptions in the traditional sense, and it also does not have any try/catch/finally type of structure.  Instead, it relies on multiple return values to handle errors.  You will commonly see code that looks like this:
```Go
result, err = functionThatCanFail(a,b)
```
Where you are expected to check out the value of `err`, the second return value, and handle it yourself from there.  While this is a little more work than a try/catch/finally structure, it also supposedly reduces overhead.  
Go does allow for aliasing.  Interestingly enough though, it won't let you reuse variable names in the same scope but with different types.  Example below:
```Go
dog := 64
dog = "string" // type mismatch, so compiler error
dog := "string" // dog was originally an int, compiler error
```

## Example Program
#### Un-Weighted _k_ Nearest Neighbors
```Go
// sorted points list from before
points[]
var results[]Point

results.append(points[0])
results.append(points[1])
results.append(points[2])

int index = 3
stillPulling = true

for stillPulling {
  if points[2].d == points[index].d {
    results.append(points[index])
    index++
   } else {
    stillPulling = false
   }
}
```
